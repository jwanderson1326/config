I see you've shared a Python function definition. To work with this code, I need to know:

1. What file is this code currently in?
2. What changes would you like me to make to this function?

Please let me know the full file path where this code exists and what modifications you'd like me to make.

I need to see the file where these keymaps are defined to convert them to Lua. Based on your repository structure, these keymaps are likely in one of your Neovim configuration files.

Could you please add the file that contains these keymaps to the chat? It's likely in one of these locations:
- dotfiles/.config/nvim/init.vim
- dotfiles/.config/nvim/lua/janderson/remap.lua

> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(A)ll/(S)kip all/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

I'll convert those Vim keymaps to Lua format. Since these keymaps don't appear in the files you've shared, I'll add them to the `dotfiles/.config/nvim/lua/janderson/remap.lua` file, which is where your other keymaps are defined.

Here's the change:

dotfiles/.config/nvim/lua/janderson/remap.lua
```lua
<<<<<<< SEARCH
--- Nav
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>R", ":ReplToggle<CR>")
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>r", "<Plug>(ReplSendLine)")
vim.keymap.set("x", "<leader>r", "<Plug>(ReplSendVisual)")
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>c", "<Plug>(ReplSendCell)")

vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>c", "<Plug>(ReplSendCell)")

This file appears to be a set of rules and guidelines for creating and formatting *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks* when making code changes. These blocks are a structured way to propose edits to files.

The key points from this file are:

1. It defines a specific format for SEARCH/REPLACE blocks that includes:
   - The full file path on a line by itself
   - Code fences with language specification
   - Special markers for search and replace sections
   - Exact matching requirements for the search section

2. It provides guidelines for creating effective SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:
   - Keep them concise
   - Break large changes into smaller blocks
   - Only include enough context to uniquely identify the section to change
   - Only create blocks for files that have been added to the chat

3. It includes special instructions for:
   - Moving code within a file (use two separate blocks)
   - Creating new files (use empty SEARCH section)
   - Handling user responses

This appears to be a reference document for a specific code editing workflow, likely used in a chat-based code editing system where precise change instructions are needed.
